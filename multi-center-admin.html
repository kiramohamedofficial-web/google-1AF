I want to improve the Owner Dashboard display system for adding classes.

Requirements:

1. Teacher Selection

When creating a new class, the owner should choose from the already registered teachers in the system.



2. Internal Time System

There should be a built-in system to select:

Days of the week (e.g., Sunday, Monday, etc.)

Time slots (start & end time) for scheduling classes.
